# Cats-vs-Dogs
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to develop a model for distinguishing Cats and Dogs pictures.
This Deep Learning project is to build an image classifier. This project takes catsVSdogs dataset for training and testing the neural network. In this project, we have did:

Create a neural network in Keras for image classification
Prepare the dataset for training and testing
Visualize the dataset
Save the model
Test our model performance on custom data

Steps:
:Importing the libraries
Part 1 - Data Preprocessing
       - Preprocessing the Training set
       - Preprocessing the Test set
Part 2 - Building the CNN
       - Initialising the CNN
       - Convolution
       - Pooling
:Adding a second convolutional layer
       - Flattening
       - Full Connection
       - Output Layer
       - Training the CNN
:Compiling the CNN
:Training the CNN on the Training set and evaluating it on the Test set
